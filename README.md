Table-Tennis-Rating-Calculator
==============================

This is an application that calculates your new table tennis rating after a match.

This application calculates your new score based on the USATT Rating Processing System found [here](http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Table-Tennis/Ratings/How-Does-the-USATT-Rating-System-work)

Currently, the application is only able to calculate your new score after one match; but I am currently working on adding support for inputting multiple matches by manual input or a text file.
